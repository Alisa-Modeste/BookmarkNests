About
A Google Chrome extension
Written in Javascript

Instead of trying to decide which of your folders your bookmark is better suited for, put it in both "folders." BookmarkNests is capable of "dynamic folders." When searching through your bookmarks, click the first tag, or "folder," then pick one of the sub-tags.

Current version is ideal for smaller number of bookmarks. (i.e closer to 100 than 5000).
